## TODO:
- Make incorrect square red
- Make top-left in play text change upon failed & change to grid completed!
- Mobile mode
- Save & Load (requires making a node module) + FireBase work
- End the game when the grid is failed
- Overall code cleanup & grid encapsulation. This is to prevent sketch from writing functions that should be grid based
